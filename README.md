**Observable Trends**
	As we expect, the number of rides and drivers increase as we go from Rural to Suburban and finally Urban cities (Pyber Ride Sharing Data (2016)). Our graph displays a loose negative correlation between Average Fare ($) and Total Number of Rides (Per City)), although the rural cities by themselves do not seem to show any kind of meaningful correlation. 
	
	We can identify more precise discrepancies between suburban and urban cities by looking at our pie charts. Percent of Total Drivers by City Type shows that Urban drivers make up the lionâ€™s share of total drivers with a percentage of 80.89% while suburban drivers make up 16.48% of total drivers (differential of 64.41%). Comparing this with the Total Rides by City Type, we see that riders requesting service in urban cities make up 68.42% of total drivers while suburban riders comprise 26.32% (differential of 42.1%).
	
	When looking at the Percent of Total Fares by City Type pie chart, urban cities charge 62.72% of total fares while suburban cities charge 30.46% (32.26% differential). In this category, urban and suburban cities have much more parity relative to Riders and especially Drivers. We might infer that the greater supply differential of drivers between urban and suburban drivers relative to the demand differential is allowing suburban drivers to charge higher prices for their services.
